# Slack status updater script

This script will keep updating your slack status every 'x' minutes until you are back to desk.

## Why?

Lets say you went to a break for break for few minutes and set 'AFK' status and once you are back, you forgot to clear status. Using this, as soon as you come back to desk it will prompt you to clear status.
